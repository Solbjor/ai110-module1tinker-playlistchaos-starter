# Playlist Chaos

Your AI assistant tried to build a smart playlist generator. The app runs, but some of the behavior is unpredictable. Your task is to explore the app, investigate the code, and use an AI assistant to debug and improve it.

This activity is your first chance to practice AI-assisted debugging on a codebase that is slightly messy, slightly mysterious, and intentionally imperfect.

You do not need to understand everything at once. Approach the app as a curious investigator, work with an AI assistant to explain what you find, and make targeted improvements.

# Recap/Summary

The main concept for this particular activity was to help students get an understanding about how to work with AI to gain a fundamental understanding of how the PlayListChaos app works, from its functions to its UI, as well as indirectly teaching how to setup Streamlit for running the app locally on your webhost. For this particular app, one of the issues I encountered was that the song search function would not properly display results unless the full artist name was typed out, save for a few exceptions if you wrote a sentence in the search bar a certain way. The way I encountered this issue, and the way I would direct students to do so, was by first analyzing everything in the app itself, plugging and playing different things in the search bar, messing with the buttons, and trying to see how the logic handled certain inputs and referring back to the code to find the problem spot. In order to speed up the process I leveraged Copilot in a way that you explain the functionality you are expecting to see, the functionality you actually see, and narrow down where the problem could be, and it can then help pinpoint specific areas that may be failing so that you can analyze them yourself. It can also double check the logic is working the way you describe it should be. The one downside is you must be as specific as possible to ensure that the AI doesn't veer off path from what you are requesting it to view, and its something I would definitely emphasize to students while working through this assignment. When it comes to debugging/fixing the code, students should be careful with anything generated by the AI and strictly vet it. For instance while fixing the search functionality, ensure that you implement test cases to verify yourself whether the functionality has been properly fixed, rather than relying on AI to give you the answer directly. Same goes for the refactoring step, query for potential areas that may be unreliable, analyze and test, then implement possible solutions that you and the AI can come up with and re-test to verify.

## How the code is organized

### `app.py`  

The Streamlit user interface. It handles things like:

- Showing and updating the mood profile  
- Adding songs  
- Displaying playlists  
- Lucky pick  
- Stats and history

### `playlist_logic.py`  

The logic behind the app, including:

- Normalizing and classifying songs  
- Building playlists  
- Merging playlist data  
- Searching  
- Computing statistics  
- Lucky pick mechanics

You will need to look at both files to understand how the app behaves.

## What you will do

### 1. Explore the app  

Run the app and try things out:

- Add several songs with different titles, artists, genres, and energy levels  
- Change the mood profile  
- Use the search box  
- Try the lucky pick  
- Inspect the playlist tabs and stats  
- Look at the history  

As you explore, write down at least five things that feel confusing, inconsistent, or strange. These might be bugs, quirks, or unexpected design decisions.

### 2. Ask AI for help understanding the code  

Pick one issue from your list. Use an AI coding assistant to:

- Explain the relevant code sections  
- Walk through what the code is supposed to do  
- Suggest reasons the behavior might not match expectations  

For example:

> "Here is the function that classifies songs. The app is mislabeling some songs. Help me understand what the function is doing and where the logic might need adjustment."

Before making changes, summarize in your own words what you think is happening.

### 3. Fix at least four issues  

Make improvements based on your investigation.

For each fix:

- Identify the source of the issue  
- Decide whether to accept or adjust the AI assistant's suggestions  
- Update the code  
- Add a short comment describing the fix  

Your fixes may involve logic, calculations, search behavior, playlist grouping, lucky pick behavior, or anything else you discover.

### 4. Test your changes  

After each fix, try interacting with the app again:

- Add new songs  
- Change the profile  
- Try search and stats  
- Check whether playlists behave more consistently  

Confirm that the behavior matches your expectations.

### 5. Optional stretch goals  

If you finish early or want an extra challenge, try one of these:

- Improve search behavior  
- Add a "Recently added" view  
- Add sorting controls  
- Improve how Mixed songs are handled  
- Add new features to the history view  
- Introduce better error handling for empty playlists  
- Add a new playlist category of your own design

## Tips for success

- You do not need to solve everything. Focus on exploring and learning.  
- When confused, ask an AI assistant to explain the code or summarize behavior.  
- Test the app often. Small experiments reveal useful clues.  
- Treat surprising behavior as something worth investigating.  
- Stay curious. The unpredictability is intentional and part of the experience.

When you finish, Playlist Chaos will feel more predictable, and you will have taken your first steps into AI-assisted debugging.
